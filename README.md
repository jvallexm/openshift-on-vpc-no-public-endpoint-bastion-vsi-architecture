# Red Hat OpenShift on VPC With no Public Endpoint

This template creates a multizone VPC, an OpenShift cluster on that VPC, and bastion VSI on a proxy subnet to allow communication with the cluster over the private service endpoint.

## Table of Contents

-----

## IBM Cloud Resources

This module creates IBM Cloud resources that exist outside of the VPC. These resources can be found in the [./resources](./resources) module.

### Resources

This module creates an IBM Cloud Object Stroage instance required for the creation of an OpenShift cluster. This module also creates a Key Protect instance and a Key Protect Root Key to encrypt the cluster. To ensure that the COS instance has access to the cluster, an authorization policy is created to allow the Key Protect instance to read from the COS instance.

### Logging and Monitoring Resources

In addition, this module creates a LogDNA instance and a Sysdig instance.

-----

## VPC

This module creates a VPC with any number of subnets across 1, 2, or 3 zones. These subnets are where the OpenShift cluster will be provisioned. It also creates a single proxy subnet where the bastion Windows and Linux VSI will be created.

The VPC resources can be found in the [multizone_vpc](/multizone_vpc) folder.

-----

### Proxy Subnet

In addition to the subnets created for the cluster, a proxy subnet is created in zone 1 by default. A public gateway is attached to this subnet to allow the VSI provisioned inside to communicate with the internet.

-----

### Access Control List

The VPC in this template uses an Access Control List to direct traffic. This traffic pattern is based on the [OpenShift VPC Network Policy Documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc-network-policy#acls).

The following ACL Rules are created automatically on provision:

#### Static ACL Rules

These ACL rules will be automatically created for the VPC regardless of subnet CIDR blocks:

Direction | Rule                                                          | Allow / Deny | Protocol | Source         | Source Port   | Destination   | Desination Port
----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------|----------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------
Inbound   | Allow Worker Nodes to be Created                              | Allow        | All      | 161.26.0.0/16  | -             | 0.0.0.0/0     | -
Inbound   | Allow communication to Services over Private Service Endpoint | Allow        | All      | 166.8.0.0/14   | -             | 0.0.0.0/0     | -
Inbound   | Allow incoming traffic requests to apps on worker nodes       | Allow        | TCP      | 0.0.0.0/0      | 30000 - 32767 | 0.0.0.0/0     | -
Inbound   | Allow load balancer and ingress app incoming traffic          | Allow        | TCP      | 0.0.0.0/0      | Any           | 0.0.0.0/0     | 443
Outbound  | Allow Worker Nodes to be Created                              | Allow        | All      | 0.0.0.0/0      | -             | 161.26.0.0/16 | -
Outbound  | Allow communication to Services over Private Service Endpoint | Allow        | All      | 0.0.0.0/0      | -             | 166.8.0.0/14  | -
Outbound  | Allow incoming traffic requests to apps on worker nodes       | Allow        | TCP      | 0.0.0.0/0      | 30000 - 32767 | 0.0.0.0/0     | -
Outbound  | Allow load balancer and ingress app incoming traffic          | Allow        | TCP      | 0.0.0.0/0      | Any           | 0.0.0.0/0     | 443

#### Dynamic ACL Rules

For each subnet in the VPC, a rule is created to allow inbound and outbound traffic from that subnet. In addition, a rule is created to allow all traffic to the proxy VSI subnet. Here is an example of the dynamically created rules using the CIDR blocks found in [variables.tf](variables.tf).

Direction | Allow / Deny | Protocol | Source         | Source Port   | Destination    | Desination Port
----------|--------------|----------|----------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------
Inbound   | Allow        | All      | 10.10.10.0/24  | -             | 0.0.0.0/0      | -
Inbound   | Allow        | All      | 10.40.10.0/24  | -             | 0.0.0.0/0      | -
Inbound   | Allow        | All      | 10.70.10.0/24  | -             | 0.0.0.0/0      | -
Inbound   | Allow        | All      | 10.100.10.0/24 | -             | 0.0.0.0/0      | -
Inbound   | Allow        | All      | 0.0.0.0/0      | -             | 10.100.10.0/24 | -
Outbound  | Allow        | All      | 0.0.0.0/0      | -             | 10.10.10.0/24  | -
Outbound  | Allow        | All      | 0.0.0.0/0      | -             | 10.40.10.0/24  | -
Outbound  | Allow        | All      | 0.0.0.0/0      | -             | 10.70.10.0/24  | -
Outbound  | Allow        | All      | 0.0.0.0/0      | -             | 10.100.10.0/24 | -
Outbound  | Allow        | All      | 10.100.10.0/24 | -             | 0.0.0.0/0      | -

#### Adding Additional Rules

The `multizone_vpc` module accepts an `acl_rules` argument that allows for the creation of additional ACL rules.

-----

### Security Group Rule

A security group rule is created for the default VPC security group to allow all inbound traffic within the VPC.

The `multizone_vpc` module accepts a `security_group_rules` argument that allows for the creation of additional rules to be added to the default VPC security group.

-----

## ROKS Cluster

This module creates a Red Hat OpenShift Cluster across all the subnets created for the [VPC](##VPC) except for the proxy subnet. This module can also dynamically create additional worker pools across the subnet. When the cluster has finished creating, the module will also install LogDNA and Sysdig agents onto the cluster.

The cluster resources can be found in the [roks_cluster](/roks_cluster) folder.

-----

### Cluster Logging and Monitoring

This module creates a resource key for the Sysdig and LogDNA resource instances created by the [resources module](##resources). These keys are used to install LogDNA and Sysdig agents onto the cluster after provision.

-----

## Bastion VSI

This module creates two VSI in the [VPC proxy subnet](###proxysubnet). A linux VSI that uses terraform to create an NLB proxy, and a Windows VSI. Both of these instances can be used to manage the OpenShift cluster.

For each VSI, a floating IP is created to allow connection from your local machine.

-----

### Linux VSI

This VSI to create an NLB Proxy to allow access to the cluster via the Private Service Endpoint. To read more about accessing the cluster through a private service endpoint refer to the [documentation here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-access_cluster#access_private_se).

The virtual server by default uses the [install_terraform_vsi](./bastion_vsi/scripts/install_terraform_vsi.sh) script to install terraform, write the script inside the VSI, and run the script.

In addition, the IBM Cloud CLI, kubectl CLI, and OpenShift CLI are installed inside the VSI to test connectivity.

The VSI is created in [bastion_vsi/linux_vsi_and_nlb_proxy.tf](./bastion_vsi/linux_vsi_and_nlb_proxy.tff)

To view the code that will be installed on the VSI, refer to the [./bastion_vsi/scripts/nlb_terraform](./bastion_vsi/scripts/nlb_terraform) folder.

-----

### Windows VSI

The windows VSI uses user data to install `chocolatey` and `kubectl`. Use this script to install the IBM Cloud CLI onto your Windows instance:

```
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://clis.cloud.ibm.com/install/powershell')
```

For more information on connecting to your Windows instance, read the documentation [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc-on-classic-vsi?topic=vpc-on-classic-vsi-connecting-to-your-windows-instance)
